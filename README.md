# eurekaclinical-webapp-archetype
This project is an maven archetype that helps you create a base eurekaclinical webapp project that you can build on.
A working webapp project created based on this archetype takes care of jersey/guice configurations and inherits basic API's from eurekaclinical common that every eurekaclinical webapp project will need to have. A sample.jsp and a corresponding ViewSampleServlet.java is  included as a sample page to demonstrate the workflow, jersey client/server communication and for testing purposes. 

The project can be created using the following command. Change the -DartifactId name accordingly and the -DarchetypeVersion to version of the archetype that you want to use. 

*mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local -DarchetypeGroupId=org.eurekaclinical -DarchetypeArtifactId=eurekaclinical-webapp-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=org.eurekaclinical -DartifactId=eurekaclinical-projectname-webapp*

specify a version or enter when prompted with Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: 

Confirm on package: org.eurekaclinical

A folder with the new project should be created in the current directory. In this example: eurekaclinical-projectname-webapp
type *cd eurekaclinical-projectname-webapp*

type *mvn notice:generate*

Change the module-name property in the pom.xml to the name of the module you are trying to implement. Keep this consistent with the corresponding service project if you want them both to use the same application.properties. Also the service URL's and webapp URL's 
for the module are looked up based on this property in WebappProperties class. 

This project can be tested before you build on it using embedded tomcat. change the application.properties values accordingly. Also update
service-artifact-id & service-artifact-version property in the pom.xml. open https://localhost:8443/webapp-project-name/protected/view
link on your browser to test.
